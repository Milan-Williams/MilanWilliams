Trip planner, Shortest and lowest cost pathways 
# Projects Descrption 
My project is a c++ project that essentially implements a program to model and help user's analyze trips between cities.
It will calculate what the shortest path is, the lowest costing path, and in a way offers a comprehensive view or representation of trips.
This is done by using adjacency matrices. The progrom I provided uses algoritmhs as well such as the Dijkstra's and Depth-First Search (DFS) to solve real-world problems involving route optimization.
# My primary goals were 
Calculating the shortest path or routes between cities 
Help users determine the lowest cost of travel routes
Also notify the user of all possible paths between cities 
Display the distance and cost matrices to help users with transperancy
Essentially my program aims to do it's best to be a practical tool and got done so by applying discrete structures to do so.
# Program Approaches 
Adjacency Matrix - using the connections to the cities such as distance and cost which are modeled as matrices which makes access more efficent 
Dijkstra's Algorithm - This is what finds the shortest path and as well finds the lowest cost paths between the cities
DFS - This is what provides all of the possible paths between the cities 
Matrix Printing -this is what outputs the adjacency matrices so the relationships can be visuialized

# Basic instructions for running my program 
You must use a c++ compiler in order to compile my code 
Once the code is in the compiler you can run the program 
# Understand the ouput 
the program will display the following
- the distance and cost materices
- the shortest distances from the source city to all the other cities
-  also the lowest cost from the source city to all the other cities
-  And finally all of the possible paths between the source city to other cities
# Modify code instructions 
- You can modify the code by updating the "cities" vector and the adjacency matrices (distanceMatrix and costMatrix) if you choose to work with different cities or other data.
